Welcome to the National Biomedical Image Archive (NBIA) Project!
=====================================

National Biomedical Image Archive (NBIA) is an Open Source project the provides the functionalities of searchable repository of in vivo images 
that provides the biomedical research community, industry, and academia with access to image archives to be used in the development and validation of analytical software tools that support:
	* Lesion detection and classification
	* Accelerated diagnostic imaging decision
	* Quantitative imaging assessment of drug response

NBIA provides access to imaging resources that will improve the use of imaging in today's biomedical research and practice by:
	* Increasing the efficiency and reproducibility of imaging cancer detection and diagnosis
	* Leveraging imaging to provide an objective assessment of therapeutic response
	* Ultimately enabling the development of imaging resources that will lead to improved clinical decision support.
