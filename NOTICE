This project was developed as part of the NCI caBIG initiative.

In 2013, as part of the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Open Development Initiative, the National Biomedical Image Archive  source code was migrated to GitHub to allow further development by the broader
community.

NBIA is a searchable repository of in vivo images that provides the biomedical research community, industry, and academia with access to image archives to be used in the development and validation of analytical software tools.

The project was initially developed by Science Applications International Corporation ("SAIC") under funding from the CBIIT office of the National Cancer Institute.
