Introduction
---------------------------

The National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) provides access 
to in vivo images. The goal of the NBIA is to provide 
the cancer research community,industry, and academia with 
access to an imaging data archive that will assist in the 
development and validation of analytical software tools 
supporting: lesion detection and classification, accelerated 
diagnostic imaging decision throughput, and quantitative 
imaging assessment of drug response. The repository aims to 
provide access to imaging resources that will improve the use 
of imaging in today’s cancer research and practice by: 
increasing the efficiency and reproducibility of imaging 
supporting cancer detection, improving the accuracy of imaging 
supporting cancer diagnosis, leveraging imaging to provide an 
objective assessment of therapeutic response, and ultimately 
enabling the development of imaging resources that will lead 
to confident clinical decisions in patient care.
